#Android Test Project
##MVP + extending base activities

Quick and dirty project to experiment with/learn about extending base classes in MVP architecture

Goal: Create 2 activities with slightly different functionality that share the same UI.  

In this case, one activity adds a new record, and a second activity updates an existing record.  Both use the same form UI for user input.
